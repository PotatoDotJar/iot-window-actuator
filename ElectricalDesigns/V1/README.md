This hand-made board was one of my many early prototype boards. It uses a full ESP32 development board and suffered from poor power delivery to the microcontroller causing weird issues such as the WiFi going out randomly, the web server stops responding after the first request, Bluetooth BLE loosing communication, etc.

While this was an early prototype, it established the base circuit design.
