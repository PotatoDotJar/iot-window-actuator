# iot-window-actuator-firmware
ESP32 Firmware for a IOT window actuator I built for a client. Note: This is not the whole project. For security reasons the rest of the project remains private.


# The Project
These devices are used in a wedding barn venue to remotely open and close windows in the rafters as well as monitor the air temperature. I have worked on this project on the side for over two years while going to school and working as a developer. This project has tested my knowledge on various subjects outside of software development such as electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. I have strengthened my knowledge on these subjects substantially through my many mistakes and itterations in my designs. With my CAD class in high school and my self taught hobbiest electronics skills, I managed to make a fully functional IOT sliding window opener using various 8020 parts, 3D printed parts I designed, and circuit boards which were designed by me using EasyEDA and manufactured though JLC PCB (see images in the Electrical folder for designs).
